# Shnist Archetype

Archetype for small scale websites. Aims to use the latest techniques and best practices.

## Features

* Small screen first responsive
* Barebones Grunt included
	* CSS linting
	* JavaScript linting.
	* FTP uploading

## Warnings

I made the deliberate decision to make this a future looking project. So, while I have included
some polyfills to make things like HTML5 elements workable in IE8, anyone who is on IE8 without
JavaScript will suffer. Good.

## Dependencies

* Node
	* Grunt
* jQuery
* Require.js
